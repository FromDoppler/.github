# Doppler Projects

In this project we will add common documentation for all Doppler Projects.

Edit the file `profile/README.md` to update [FromDoppler organization Overview](https://github.com/FromDoppler/).
See more details in [GitHub Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/customizing-your-organizations-profile#organization-profile-readmes).

See [Jenkinsfile tasks](./Jenkinsfile) for a reference about our code conventions.
